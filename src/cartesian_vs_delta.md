# Pro and contra list between a cartesian and a delta printer

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

| |Cartesian|Delta|
|---|---|---|
velocity / acceleration|higher number of movable parts -> high inertia; axis have different inertia -> max v&a is different for every axis| moved mass / number of movable parts small -> small inertia -> relatively high printing speed possible|
