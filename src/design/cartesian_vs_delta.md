# Pro and contra list between a cartesian and a delta printer

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

|	criteria | Cartesian	| Delta |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| velocity / acceleration | higher number of movable parts<br/>&emsp;&#8594; high inertia<br/>&emsp;&#8594; max v & a is different for every axis | moved mass / number of movable parts small<br/>&emsp;&#8594; small inertia<br/>&emsp;&#8594; relatively high printing speed possible |
| accuracy | Keine klare Aussage möglich. Scheint hauptsächlich von der Bauqualität und der Kalibrierung abzuhängen. | |
|reliability | Calibration has to be checked befor every print. (difficult) | Calibration has to be checked before every print. (easy) |
| | Has to be calibrated often | Has to be calibrated seldom |
|Calibration | Easy. Axis independent. | Difficult. Especailly the first calibration. Axis dependent. <br/>&emsp;&#8594; if one printer axis is false all cartesian axis are false |
