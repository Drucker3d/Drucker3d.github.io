# Idea

TODO

Because we use multiple Operating Systems we wanted to make the Printer Software 'Platform independent'.
This leaves us with 2 Options:
- Use Cross-Platform Libraries for the Gui, ...
- Use a Website which allows the user to upload the file he/she wants to get printed

We chose Option 2 because:
- Every OS should have an Browser to access the site <br/>&emsp;&#8594; Every OS with a (modern) Browser may 
- There is no need for backwards compatibility. <br/>&emsp;&#8594; Admins must update the software on the pi once instead of updating the users software/force the user to update the software

For a more detailed Reason see [Design](design/design.html)
