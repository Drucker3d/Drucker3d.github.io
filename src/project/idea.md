# Idea

TODO

Because we use multiple Operating Systems we wanted to make the Printer Software 'Platform independent'.
This leaves us with 2 Options:
- Use Cross-Platform Libraries for the Gui, ...
- Use a Website which allows the user to upload the file he/she wants to get printed

In the end we chose Option 2.

For a detailed Reason see [Design](design/design.html)
